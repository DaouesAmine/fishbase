FishBase REST API
=================

This project provides a RESTful frontend to the FishBase database. Stable builds can be seen running here: http:/www.deepspaceweb.com/fb

Requirements
---------------
* PHP 5.2.x+
* Apache HTTP Server (w/ mod_rewrite)
* MySQL

Installation
---------------
Assuming you have successfully installed the database and it is named 'fbapp'...

* Open `/conf/fbapp-conf.php` and edit lines 13 & 14, substituting the correct login credentials for the `fbapp` database instance.
* Point your browser to `/index.php`. Clicking on the displayed links should result in a response from the API displaying DB data.
* Problems? Open an issue.

Directory Structure
-------------------

Not the most intuitive, but here is the current directory layout and what each part means:

```
|-api
|-- .htaccess : Auto-route all requests using mod_rewrite to index.php
|-- index.php : Entry-point to all API calls.
|- classes    : ORM layer. Entities map to DB and query interfaces.
|- clientresources: JS, CSS, and Images used by the root index.php client.
|- conf       : DB Configuration file
|- docs       : General documentation.
|-- swagger-ui  : API Docs.
|- vendor     : Third-party PHP libraries. Generated by Composer.
```

API Documentation
-----------------

To run the API documentation library:

`php swagger.phar ../../../classes ../../../api -o ../../../docs/api-docs --default-base-path /fishbase/api --default-api-version 0.10`

`swagger.phar` can be found under: `C:\Development\fishbase\vendor\zircote\swagger-php`

Note that the default base path will change depending on where the api resides relative to the documentation.

This will generate the documentation in JSON form under the `docs/api-docs` directory, by scanning the `classes` and `api` directories for Swagger annotations.

For now, a sample documentation and API itself can be tested at: http://deepspaceweb.com/fishbase/
